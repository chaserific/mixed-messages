# mixed-messages
codecademy paired project

This project requirement is to create code that generates random messages and uses three pieces of data. 
My pairing partner came up with the idea of basing this on the Magic Eigth Ball Game but using an interactive 
web app that takes user input of name and a question then responds to user and question with a random answer.
We took the idea a little further by adding HTML and CSS designing an eigth ball with input fields for name and
question and a display window that responds to the user, repeats the question and returns a random message response.
