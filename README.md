# mixed-messages
codecademy paired project

The project requirement is to create code that generates random messages and uses three pieces of data. 
We decided to base our project on the Magic Eight Ball game. Our code would take three data inputs:
  *User Name
  *User Question
  *An array of randome answer strings
The user inputs name and a question then clicks the submit button.
A display window returns a message containing the user name and question supplied by the user and a randomly generated answer.

We built a repo on GITHUB that we could both access, make changes, and commits; as well as live sharing on VS Code to build the files. 
All in all, a really enjoyable exercise.
